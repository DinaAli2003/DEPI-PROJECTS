## üéØ Core Focus & Deliverables

The primary objective of these projects is to transform raw environmental and operational data into **actionable Business Intelligence (BI)**, promoting eco-friendly manufacturing practices, efficiency, and cost optimization.

| Metric / Focus Area | Primary Tools Used | Methodology & Business Deliverable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Carbon Footprint Analysis** | SQL, Python, Power BI | **Scope 1/2/3 Emissions Modeling.** Utilized **MySQL Window Functions** for benchmarking and **Pandas** for time-series forecasting to predict future emission risks. |
| **Water Usage Optimization** | SQL, Excel, Python | **Water Intensity Metric (Liters/Unit of Production).** Performed **IQR-based Outlier Detection** in SQL to ensure data fidelity. Modeled potential savings in Excel. |
| **Waste Management Metrics** | SQL, Power BI, Tableau | **Circular Economy Index Tracking (Recycling Rate).** Created interactive Tableau/Power BI dashboards to monitor real-time waste-to-landfill ratios and diversion strategies. |
| **Sustainable Cost-Benefit** | Excel, Tableau | **Return on Investment (ROI) Analysis.** Developed specialized Excel models for calculating the payback period for capital investments in sustainable technology. |
| **Comparative Performance Analysis** | SQL, Python (Seaborn/Matplotlib) | **Segmentation:** Analyzed performance gaps based on **Material Type**, **Brand Category**, and **Region**. Used **NTILE** functions in SQL for competitive ranking. |

## üõ†Ô∏è The Data & Analytics Stack Deep Dive

This section details my proficiency across the data pipeline, emphasizing reproducible and efficient methodologies.

### üíª Data Wrangling & Advanced Analysis

| Tool | Technical Proficiency | Key Usage in Projects |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SQL** | **MySQL**, CTEs, Views, Window Functions, DDL/DML | **ETL Foundation:** Efficient data aggregation, metric calculation, data validation, and **data integrity checks** (handling NULLs and IQR outliers). Utilized **CTEs and Views** for modular query design. |
| **Python** | Pandas, NumPy, **Seaborn, Matplotlib** | **Statistical Modeling & EDA:** Advanced feature engineering, correlation analysis, and building simple **regression models**. Utilized **Pandas** for transformation and **Seaborn/Matplotlib** for generating static, high-quality analytical charts for reports and statistical visualization. |
| **Excel** | Financial Modeling, Pivot Tables| **Input/Output Layer:** Used for granular **cost-benefit modeling**, sensitivity analysis, and structured data templates (crucial for accurate ROI calculation). |

### üìä Visualization & Business Intelligence (BI)

* **Power BI:** Developed multi-page, drill-down dashboards focused on monitoring real-time **Environmental KPIs (e-KPIs)** and operational performance, directly supporting executive decision-making.
* **Tableau:** Created high-impact, public-facing visualizations and data stories to clearly communicate complex environmental trends and progress to diverse audiences.
